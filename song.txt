It's supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound precocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I

Because I was afraid to speak
When I was just a lad
Me father gave me nose a tweak
And told me I was bad

U-la-la-la
And this is how it goes
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

But then one day I learned a word
That saved me aching nose
The biggest word you ever heard
And this is how it goes
Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

Even though the sound of it
Is something quite atrocious
If you say it loud enough
You'll always sound superprecocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I
Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-I

Um-dittle-ittl-um-dittle-Iâ€¦
